UFC is an Arduino project to interface a button box made of button switches
and rotary encoders with a computer and identify itself as a game controller
sending DirectX events.

The core of the system is a Sparkfun Pro Micro or clone (small Arduino
Micro/Leonardo compatible). The switches are attached directly to the Arduino
analog inputs grids with resistors, while the encoders directly attached
to digital pins and managed by the custom made REncoderAsync library.
The Joystick library interfaces with the computer and presents the Arduino
itself as a game controller.

More info can be found in the doc directory, including schematics and
pictures.

* To test whether the controller is recognized by a Linux the computer, you can
use the following command:

$ dmesg | grep Joystick

* Use the device name as follows to check the events sent to the computer:
$ jstest /dev/input/js1
